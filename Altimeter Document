Altimeter documents

Recipes on altimeter data processing to get the best mean sea surface slope
Using Sentinel-3A/B as examples

Step 1:
Reading original (*.nc) files where there are hundreds of parameters and dump the 20 hz values we want to binary format.

code directory: 
/cryostat/mgg/alt/rfmt_s3
data structure:
s3ab20hz.h
code:
s3ab20hz *.nc >> outfile

working directory: 
S3/cdr (in external disk Sentinel 3)
scripts:
process_all_step1_S3A.csh
process_all_step1_S3B.csh
input: *.nc files
output (binary): S3A.S20, S3B.S20
to look at the output:
gmtconvert S3A.S20 -bi11i,i8h | more



Step 2: to get *.int
edit bad data (flag, swh, ssha, mqe) then low-pass filtered into 5/sec data

code directory: 
/cryostat/mgg/alt/retrack/src/s3ab20_cdr
code:
s3ab20_cdr 1 S3A.S20 sentinel3Aa.int sentinel3Ad.int 1
s3ab20_cdr 1 S3B.S20 sentinel3Ba.int sentinel3Bd.int 0
filter: 99-point Parks-McClellan filter

working directory: 
S3/cdr (in external disk Sentinel 3)
scripts:
process_all_cdr_step2.csh
input: S3A.S20, S3B.S20
output (binary): sentinela.int, sentineld.int
to look at the output:
gmtconvert sentinela.int -bi7i | more
or
fmtcdr sentinela.int | more



Step 3: to get *.edt, *.flt, *.cor, *.binc
Edit with respect to EGM2008 when along track slope of the data minus the global grid of sea surface height exceeds a threshold;
Filter altimeter data along track;
Apply slope correction;
Make binary xyds files for global gridding programs.

code directory:
cryosat/mgg/alt/cdr/src

working directory: 
cryosat2/gravity/filtered_data
scripts:
prepare_sentinel.com


*.int are in 28-byte binary format
fmtcdr *.int | more
gmtconvert *.int -bi7i| more

utcsec (s)
microsec (1e-6)
lat (1e-6)
lon (1e-6)
ssh (alt-range, 0.1 mm)
swh (0.1 mm)
???


*.edt, *.flt, *.cor are in 28-byte binary format
gmtconvert *.edt/*.flt/*.cor -bi1d,5f| more

utcsec (s)
lat
lon
ssh (alt-range, 0.1 mm)
swh (0.1 mm)
???



*.binc are in 4-byte single-precision float binary format (lon, lat, slope)
gmtconvert *.binc -bi3f | more





Step 4: to get *.img and north_tot.img/east_tot.img
read xyds (*.binc) data from either ascending or descending and use block mean to fill the img world Mercator i*2 files.

Code directory:
/cryostat/mgg/alt/grav_img
img_ds_bm -D -S -F

Working directory:
/cryosat2/gravity/1min_V29
Script to produce individual *.img:
  pre_prcoc_sentinel.com
script to combine *.img together (to get northd.img/eastd.img):
  interp_*.com
script to get full slope (to get north_tot.img/east_tot.img):
